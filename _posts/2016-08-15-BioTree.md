The Individuals to Biodiversity (I2B) Model

In the Individuals to Biodiversity (I2B) model we are interested in how populations are limited by climate and competition. This page provides summary inference and prediction from the model. The interactive maps allow you to examine the following:

- **Observed trees** -- locations where trees are observed
- **Tree without competition** -- where individuals could survive without competition
-  **Trees with competition** -- where trees could survive in crowded stands
- **Populations** -- where viable populations could establish
- **Observed recruitment** -- locations where new recruitment is observed
- **Fecundity** -- where fecundity is positive
- **Recruitment** -- where recruitment is positive
