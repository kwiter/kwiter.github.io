<h1>Sync Music to slideshows with wavelet analysis</h1>

These slide shows represent two exercises in data analysis. The first part uses R's capability of analysing frequency data. The algorithm employs wavelet analysis to synchronize slide transitions to the music. This creates a list of slide transition time points. The next step hijacks the windows moviemaker format. The program reads in a slideshow (.wmpl) with arbitrary slide transitions and replaces the transitions with the synchronized transitions calculated during the first step. The final product is a slideshow which moves to the music.
